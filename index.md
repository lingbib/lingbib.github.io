Hey,

This is the very minimal homepage for the Lingbib project.

Lingbib is a comprehensive, collaborative linguistics bibliography for LaTeX documents.

It's currently in an alpha stage. If you're interested in learning more, check out [lingbib/lingbib][lingbib] on GitHub.

We would love help.

Best,

[Adam][adam] and [Kenneth][kenneth]
